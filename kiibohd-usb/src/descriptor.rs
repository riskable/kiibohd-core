/// NKRO Keyboard - HID Bitmap
///
/// This is a simplified NKRO descriptor as comparied to kiibohd/controller.
/// It uses 1 extra byte in each packet, but easier to understand and parse.
///
/// NOTES:
/// Supports all keys defined by the spec.
/// 0 represents "no keys pressed" so it is excluded.
/// Supports all keys defined by the spec, except 1-3 which define error events
///  and 0 which is "no keys pressed"
/// See <https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_22.pdf> Chapter 10
///
/// Special bits:
/// 0x00 - Reserved (represents no keys pressed, not useful in a bitmap)
/// 0x01 - ErrorRollOver
/// 0x02 - POSTFail
/// 0x03 - ErrorUndefined
/// 0xA5..0xAF - Reserved
/// 0xDE..0xDF - Reserved
/// 0xE8..0xFFFF - Not specified (Reserved in protocol)
///
/// Compatibility Notes:
///  - Using a second endpoint for a boot mode device helps with compatibility
///  - DO NOT use Padding in the descriptor for bitfields
///    (Mac OSX silently fails... Windows/Linux work correctly)
///  - DO NOT use Report IDs (to split the keyboard report), Windows 8.1 will not update
///    keyboard correctly (modifiers disappear)
///    (all other OSs, including OSX work fine...)
///    (you can use them *iff* you only have 1 per collection)
///  - Mac OSX and Windows 8.1 are extremely picky about padding
